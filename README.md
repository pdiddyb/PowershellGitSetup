# PowershellGitSetup
Setup files for Powershell to utilize GIT
This will create or overwrite your existing powershell profile file.
The profile file lives at $profile or c:\users\<USERID>\Documents\WindowsPowershell\Mocrosoft.Powershell_profile.ps1
It will add the lines for GIT to work and then add the lines for the console's
window size, buffer size, and colors.  You should modify those to your liking.
