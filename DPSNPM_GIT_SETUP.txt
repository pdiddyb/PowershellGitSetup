If you have trouble pulling git repos, you can set the git proxy:
git config --global http.proxy http://companyProxy:80
git config --global https.proxy http://companyProxy:80

You can set up npm to use a proxy too:
npm config set proxy http://companyProxy:80
npm config set https-proxy http://companyProxy:80

If you need a proxy for bower to work you will need to add this to your .bowerrc file in C:\Users\{Username}\.bowerrc :
{
    "proxy":"http:///companyProxy:80",
    "https-proxy":"http:///companyProxy:80"
}

If the above proxy config does not work then you will want to use a local proxy with authentication:

install cntlm proxy included in this folder.
Edit cntlm.ini at C:\Program Files (x86)\Cntlm
Change the username to your acid
change the domain to your domain
Comment out the password using #
change the proxy to the corporate proxy
open admin command prompt
cd into the cntlm directory c:\progam files (x86)\cntlm
run this cntlm.exe -H -c cntlm.ini
enter your password
then copy all three lines it gives you into the cntlm.ini file under the password you commented earlier

example:

Username	ab12345
Domain		XXX
PassLM          F7474233E7A892834792745844839AD8
PassNT          52B4D04A81234FDDE3211134E2903D05
PassNTLMv2      B71EF7BE83112374637264A08372D95E

add the proxy to your npm by opening a command prompt and typing:
npm config set proxy http://localhost:3128
npm config set https-proxy http://localhost:3128
git config --global http.proxy http://localhost:3128
git config --global https.proxy http://localhost:3128

If you need a proxy for bower to work you will need to add this to your .bowerrc file in C:\Users\{Username}\.bowerrc :
{
    "proxy":"http://localhost:3128",
    "https-proxy":"http://localhost:3128"
}


REMEMBER TO UPDATE YOUR CNTML.INI FILE WHEN YOU CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD.
